\cf0 CocoaShare Uses {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://sparkle.andymatuschak.org"}}{\fldrslt Sparkle}} for software update, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://growl.info/"}}{\fldrslt Growl}} for notifications, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://regexkit.sourceforge.net/"}}{\fldrslt RegexKit Lite}} as a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://site.icu-project.org/"}}{\fldrslt ICU}} regular expression wrapper, and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.dropbox.com/developers"}}{\fldrslt Dropbox API}} for {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.dropbox.com/"}}{\fldrslt Dropbox}} support.\

CocoaShare makes it easy for you to share files with friends using multiple services and multiple ways. With filters you can have CocoaShare find files that matches the regular expression and automatically upload them. The screenshot filter will automatically upload any screenshot taken using Mac OS X's built screenshot system. Dragging files to the dock or menu bar icon will upload them at your request. After a file is uploaded, it places the URL in your clipboard so you can easily paste it into a message for your friends. Events allows you to set options for when a file is being uploaded and when a file is uploaded, such as displaying a growl notification or playing a sound to let you know when it's uploaded. By using CocoaShare, you'll find how easy it is to share files.\
